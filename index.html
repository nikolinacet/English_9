Lesson 1 – Intro to Short Stories

Today’s Agenda:
1.	Discussion: What are short stories 
2.	Share a story with them (discuss how our culture loves a story that is told well)
3.	Discuss what they know and write on board + elements therein (word web?)
4.	Find definitions to words around room
5.	Review Definitions
6.	Watch Simpsons and Pick out terms. 

1. Introduce Short Stories
Ask the students: Before the invention of electricity (and therefore TV, radio, Ipod, 
internet etc.) What do you think people did in their spare time for fun?  Actually, they 
read and the modern sitcom, drama and cartoon take their roots from the most popular literary 
form of the nineteenth century, the short story. People were now working outside the home and 
the brevity of the short story made it popular because people did not have the time or patience 
for long drawn out novels that were popular before. 

Ask the students to think for a moment: what do we know about short stories that show us the 
modern TV developed from them: 
Potential list: 
-short in length 
-Few characters
-uncomplicated plot
- Single main conflict (Simpson’s sometimes breaks this)
-usually fictional

2. Share a story with class. (Ie: Story of me in Gr. 9 with fire on camping trip, grandpa Joe, 
or any story involving great level of detail and description.)

3. Discuss what they know and write it on the board. Get students to think of terms related to 
short stories and write it on the board. Can be anything related to the term “Short Story.”

4. Get them to find the definitions to the terms hidden all over the classroom. Put terms around 
the classroom and then students must find the definitions. 

5. Review in class. Go over the answers to this exercise as a class. 

6. Watch The Simpsons or another small film to pick out terms. Distribute the handout with short 
story terms on it. While students are watching the Simpson’s, they need to pick out examples. 
This is a review of short story terms and they will use this as a basis for study for their 
upcoming quiz on the unit. Watch “Cape Fear” episode.  Season 5 – disc 1.
